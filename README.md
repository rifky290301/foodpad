Capstone Project for Final Submission at Kampus Merdeka x Dicoding Indonesia

## Description

In the food recipes app , users are often faced with so many recipes, but rarely that really suits their needs based on the availability of ingredients they have. In response to this, we found that it would be better if an application could provide recipes that match the ingredients owned by the user right away for cooking according to the ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty level. Users can also save recipes so that they don't have to find it difficult to re-find the recipe every time they open the application.
